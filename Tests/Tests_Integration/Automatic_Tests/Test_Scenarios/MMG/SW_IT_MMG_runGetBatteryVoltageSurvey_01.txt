Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function MMG_runUpdateModeStatus at line 'mmg_UpdateModeStatus_Temperature_EOL_KL30_TensioningCycles();'.

	Step 3: Check if CPU stopped in function MMG_runUpdateModeStatus at line 'mmg_UpdateModeStatus_Temperature_EOL_KL30_TensioningCycles();'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function mmg_UpdateModeStatus_Temperature_EOL_KL30_TensioningCycles at line 'Rte_Call_pclKL30_Get(&u16Voltage);'.

Action: ARCH_SW_MMG_0406

	Step 5: Check if CPU stopped in function mmg_UpdateModeStatus_Temperature_EOL_KL30_TensioningCycles at line 'Rte_Call_pclKL30_Get(&u16Voltage);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_MMG_0406

	Step 6: Step in function Rte_Call_pclKL30_Get(&u16Voltage). 
		Expected result:  Stepped in function PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_10ms.

Action: ARCH_SW_MMG_0207, ARCH_SW_MMG_0208

	Step 8: Check if CPU stopped in function PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_10ms at line 'Rte_Call_pclKL30_V_raw_Get_10ms(&pmp_u16InternalAnalogSignal);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
