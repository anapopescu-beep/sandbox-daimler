Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Test type: automatic
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0645; ARCH_SW_DIA_0646; ARCH_SW_DIA_0647; ARCH_SW_DIA_0648; ARCH_SW_DIA_0649; ARCH_SW_DIA_0650
ARCH_SW_DIA_0645: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID 02EA (System Time)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0646: The Read System Time service shall be available in the following sessions: ?Default Session (0x01) ?Extended Session (0x03) ?Supplier Session/Development Session (0x7E)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_System_Time_read_Read_System_time_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0645; ARCH_SW_DIA_0646; ARCH_SW_DIA_0647; ARCH_SW_DIA_0648; ARCH_SW_DIA_0649; ARCH_SW_DIA_0650

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 01E0 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_System_Time_read_Read_System_time_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate *Data pointer 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
