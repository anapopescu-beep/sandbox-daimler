Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0142_AvailabilityDataRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0235; ARCH_SW_DIA_0236; ARCH_SW_DIA_0237; ARCH_SW_DIA_0238; ARCH_SW_DIA_0336; ARCH_SW_DIA_0337

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0142 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0142_AvailabilityDataRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate *Data pointer 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
