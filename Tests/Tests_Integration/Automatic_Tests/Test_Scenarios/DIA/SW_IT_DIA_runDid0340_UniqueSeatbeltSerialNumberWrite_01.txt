Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0008; ARCH_SW_DIA_0056; ARCH_SW_NVP_0001; ARCH_SW_DIA_1020
ARCH_SW_DIA_0008: Service 0x2E will be implemented for DID 0340.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0056: Response data will corespond to: Unique Seatbelt Serial number, data contained in BELT_ASSEMBLY_MANUF_DATE_AND_SN NVM block. Note edit: block will be written using the 0x2E Write Service.
ARCH_SW_NVP_0001: NVP_BLOCK_ID_BELT_ASSEMBLY_MANUF_DATE_AND_SN block shall be configured. Parameter NVP_au8AssemblySerialNumber should have 28 bytes and should store belt assembly Serial Number written at ANG (default values 0xFF).
ARCH_SW_DIA_1020: Service 0x2E (Write Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID 0340 (Seat Belt Serial Number).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter default or extended session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0340_UniqueSeatbeltSerialNumberWrite*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0008; ARCH_SW_DIA_0056; ARCH_SW_NVP_0001; ARCH_SW_DIA_1020

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0340 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0340_UniqueSeatbeltSerialNumberWrite was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_BELT_ASSEMBLY_MANUF_DATE_AND_SN_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E 0340 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
