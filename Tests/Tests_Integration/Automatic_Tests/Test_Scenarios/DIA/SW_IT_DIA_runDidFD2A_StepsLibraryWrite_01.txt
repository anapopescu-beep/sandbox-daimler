--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryWrite*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0007; ARCH_SW_DIA_0070; ARCH_SW_DIA_0085; ARCH_SW_DIA_0071

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E FD2A and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryWrite was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E FD2A 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
