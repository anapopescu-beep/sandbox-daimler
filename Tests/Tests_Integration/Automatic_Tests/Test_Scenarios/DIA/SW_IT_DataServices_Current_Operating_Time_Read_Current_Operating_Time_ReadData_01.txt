--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Start Development Session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Current_Operating_Time_Read_Current_Operating_Time_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0325; ARCH_SW_DIA_0326; ARCH_SW_DIA_0327; ARCH_SW_DIA_0467; ARCH_SW_DIA_0468; ARCH_SW_DIA_0469; ARCH_SW_DIA_0470

	Step 4: Send diag request for security access 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Current_Operating_Time_Read_Current_Operating_Time_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Evaluate Data Record 
		Expected result:  Variable was read.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
