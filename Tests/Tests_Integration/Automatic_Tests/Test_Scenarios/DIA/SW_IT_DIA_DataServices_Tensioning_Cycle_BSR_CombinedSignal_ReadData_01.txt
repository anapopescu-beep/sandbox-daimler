--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Tensioning_Cycle_BSR_CombinedSignal_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0025; ARCH_SW_DIA_0096; ARCH_SW_DIA_0097; ARCH_SW_DIA_0098;

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 0302 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Tensioning_Cycle_BSR_CombinedSignal_ReadData. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read 26th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 7: Read 28th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 8: Read 116th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 9: Read 144th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
