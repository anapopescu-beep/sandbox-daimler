Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0330; ARCH_SW_DIA_0334; ARCH_SW_DIA_0335
ARCH_SW_DIA_0330: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID 0140 (Obsolescence Data)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0334: Response data length shall be 24 bytes long: Bytes #2-#3: DataIdentifier of the Read Obsolescence Data shall be: 0x0140 Bytes #4 - #5 = Remaining BSR Activations [2bytes] : Bytes #6 - #7 = Threshold Green to Yellow for Remaining BSR Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #8 - #9 = Threshold Yellow to Red for Remaining BSR Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #10 - #11 = Remaining Low Force Activations [2bytes] : Bytes #12 - #13 = Threshold Green to Yellow for Remaining Low Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #14 - #15 = Threshold Yellow to Red for Remaining Low Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #16 - #17 = Remaining high Force Activations [2bytes] : Bytes #18 - #19 = Threshold Green to Yellow for Remaining High Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #20 - #21 = Threshold Yellow to Red for Remaining High Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #22 - #23 = Remaining Max Force Activations [2bytes] : Bytes #24 - #25 = Threshold Green to Yellow for Remaining Max Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00 Bytes #26 - #27 = Threshold Yellow to Red for Remaining Max Force Activation [2bytes] = 0x00 0x00. Note: Full Response length = 3 bytes + Response data length
ARCH_SW_DIA_0335: Read Obsolescence Data service shall return the number of remaing BSR(Comfort), Low Force, High Force, Max Force possible activation.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid00140_Obsolescence_Data_PRE_SAFE_Lvl_4_5_Treshold_Yellow_To_Red_Read*. 
		Expected result:  BP is reached

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0330; ARCH_SW_DIA_0334; ARCH_SW_DIA_0335

	Step 3: Send diag request for 01 40 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Evaluate Data Record 
		Expected result:  Variable was read.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
