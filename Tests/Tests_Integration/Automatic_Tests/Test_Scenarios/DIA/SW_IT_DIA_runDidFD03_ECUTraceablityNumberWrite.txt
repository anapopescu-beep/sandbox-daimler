Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0585; ARCH_SW_DIA_0586; ARCH_SW_DIA_0587; ARCH_SW_DIA_0588
ARCH_SW_DIA_0585: Service 0x2E (Write Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID FD03 (AEE Traceability Number And PCBA Programmed PN)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0586: The Write AEE Traceability Number And PCBA programmed PN shall be available in the following sessions: ?Supplier Session/Development Session (0x7E) 
ARCH_SW_DIA_0587: The Write AEE Traceability Number And PCBA Programmed PN service shall be available under the following forms of Authentication: ?Supplier ?Development ENHANCED ?Production 
ARCH_SW_DIA_0588: Request data shall be 22 bytes long. Note: Full Request length = 3 bytes + Response data length 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD03_ECUTraceablityNumberWrite*.

ARCH_SW_DIA_0585; ARCH_SW_DIA_0586; ARCH_SW_DIA_0587; ARCH_SW_DIA_0588

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E FD03 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD03_ECUTraceablityNumberWrite was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
