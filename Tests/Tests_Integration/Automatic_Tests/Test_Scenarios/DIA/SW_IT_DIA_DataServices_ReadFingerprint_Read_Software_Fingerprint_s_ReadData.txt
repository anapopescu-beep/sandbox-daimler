--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_ReadFingerprint_Read_Software_Fingerprint_s_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0735; ARCH_SW_DIA_0736; ARCH_SW_DIA_0737; ARCH_SW_DIA_0738

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 F15B and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_ReadFingerprint_Read_Software_Fingerprint_s_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate *Data pointer 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
