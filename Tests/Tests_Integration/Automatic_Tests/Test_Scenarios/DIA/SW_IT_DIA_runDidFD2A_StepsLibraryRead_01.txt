Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0006; ARCH_SW_DIA_0068; ARCH_SW_DIA_0069; ARCH_SW_NVP_0020l; ARCH_SW_DIA_0083

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryRead*.

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 FD2A and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 7: Read last byte (index = 1159) of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
