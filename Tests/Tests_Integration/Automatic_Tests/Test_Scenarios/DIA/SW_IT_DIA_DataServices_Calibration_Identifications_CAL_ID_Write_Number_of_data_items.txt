Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Test type: automatic
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0745; ARCH_SW_DIA_0749; ARCH_SW_DIA_0750
ARCH_SW_DIA_0745: Service 0x2E (Write Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID F804 (Calibration Identifications (CAL ID))
ARCH_SW_DIA_0749: Request data shall be 17 bytes long.Note: Full Request length = 3 bytes + Response data length
ARCH_SW_DIA_0750: Byte #4: ?bits 0-7: Number of data items Bytes #5-#21: ?bits 0-7: Calibration Identification 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Calibration_Identifications_CAL_ID_Write_Number_of_data_items*.

ARCH_SW_DIA_0745; ARCH_SW_DIA_0749; ARCH_SW_DIA_0750

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E F804 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Calibration_Identifications_CAL_ID_Write_Number_of_data_items was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
