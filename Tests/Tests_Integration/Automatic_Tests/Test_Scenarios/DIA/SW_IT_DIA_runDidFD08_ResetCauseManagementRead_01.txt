Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: Yes
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0031; ARCH_SW_DIA_0154; ARCH_SW_DIA_0155; ARCH_SW_DIA_0156
ARCH_SW_DIA_0031: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID FD08
ARCH_SW_DIA_0154: Service shall be available in Development session
ARCH_SW_DIA_0155: Response data shall be 1 byte long
ARCH_SW_DIA_0156: Response shall return Last SW Reset Cause
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in the function *DIA_runDidFD08_ResetCauseManagementRead* where the local u32WarmResetCause is assigned the warm reset cause from NVP. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0031; ARCH_SW_DIA_0154; ARCH_SW_DIA_0155; ARCH_SW_DIA_0156

	Step 3: Start Development Session.

	Step 4: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID FD08 and wait for timeout. 
		Expected result:  Timeout is occured because breakpoint was reached.

	Step 5: Overwrite u32WarmResetCause with the mask mapped to the desired warm reset cause. 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with KU32_OS_EXCEPTION_MASK.

	Step 6: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID FD08. 
		Expected result:  Response is received.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
