Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0004; ARCH_SW_DIA_0064; ARCH_SW_DIA_0065; ARCH_SW_NVP_0017; ARCH_SW_DIA_0082

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD10_CycleConfigurationRead*.

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 FD10 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD10_CycleConfigurationRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 7: Read last byte (index = 420) of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
