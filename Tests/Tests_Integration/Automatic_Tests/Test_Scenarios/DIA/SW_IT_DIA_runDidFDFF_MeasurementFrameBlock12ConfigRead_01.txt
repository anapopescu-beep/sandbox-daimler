Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0037; ARCH_SW_DIA_0171; ARCH_SW_DIA_0172; ARCH_SW_DIA_0173
ARCH_SW_DIA_0037: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID FDFF
ARCH_SW_DIA_0171: Service shall be available in Development session
ARCH_SW_DIA_0172: Response data shall be 5 bytes long
ARCH_SW_DIA_0173: Response shall return Ram Address and Size stored in NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_12_CONFIG
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigRead*.

	Step 3: Start Development Session.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0037; ARCH_SW_DIA_0171; ARCH_SW_DIA_0172; ARCH_SW_DIA_0173

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 FDFF and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read 1st of variable NVP_u32MeasFrame12RAMAddress of NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_12_CONFIG_DefaultData 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

	Step 7: Read 5th of variable of NVP_u8BlockSize NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_12_CONFIG_DefaultData 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

	Step 8: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID FDFF. 
		Expected result:  Response is received.

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
