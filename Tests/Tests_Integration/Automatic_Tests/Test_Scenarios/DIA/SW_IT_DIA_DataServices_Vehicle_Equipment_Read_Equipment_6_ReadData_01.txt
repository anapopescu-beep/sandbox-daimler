Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0027; ARCH_SW_DIA_0124; ARCH_SW_DIA_0125
ARCH_SW_DIA_0027: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID 0310
ARCH_SW_DIA_0124: Response data shall be 1 byte long
ARCH_SW_DIA_0125: Data returned shall represent Equipment 6 stored in Rte_Ct_MBBL_SsaAppl_Coding_VehicleEquipment.Equipment6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Vehicle_Equipment_Read_Equipment_6_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0027; ARCH_SW_DIA_0124; ARCH_SW_DIA_0125;

	Step 4: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID 0310 and wait for timeout. 
		Expected result:  Timeout is occured because breakpoint was reached.

	Step 5: Read Equipment 6 byte of Rte_Ct_MBBL_SsaAppl_Coding_VehicleEquipment 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 6: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID 0310. 
		Expected result:  Response is received.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
