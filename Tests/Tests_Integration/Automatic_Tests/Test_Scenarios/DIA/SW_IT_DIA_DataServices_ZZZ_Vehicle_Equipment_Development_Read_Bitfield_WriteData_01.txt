--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_ZZZ_Vehicle_Equipment_Development_Read_Bitfield_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0030; ARCH_SW_DIA_0147; ARCH_SW_DIA_0148; ARCH_SW_DIA_0149

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0311 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_ZZZ_Vehicle_Equipment_Development_Read_Bitfield_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Overwrite Rte_Ct_MBBL_SsaAppl_Coding_ZZZ_VehicleEquipment_Development with 0x1

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E 0311 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
