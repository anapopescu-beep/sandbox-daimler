Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD03_ECUTraceablityNumberRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0575; ARCH_SW_DIA_0576; ARCH_SW_DIA_0577

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0220 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD03_ECUTraceablityNumberRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate *Data pointer 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
