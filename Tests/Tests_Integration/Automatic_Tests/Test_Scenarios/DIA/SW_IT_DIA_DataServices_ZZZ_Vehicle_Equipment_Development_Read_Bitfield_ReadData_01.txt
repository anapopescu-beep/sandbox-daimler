--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_ZZZ_Vehicle_Equipment_Development_Read_Bitfield_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0029; ARCH_SW_DIA_0144; ARCH_SW_DIA_0145; ARCH_SW_DIA_0146

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 0311 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_ZZZ_Vehicle_Equipment_Development_Read_Zykluszeit_Messtechnik_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read byte Bitfield 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
