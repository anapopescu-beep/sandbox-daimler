--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0021; ARCH_SW_DIA_0086; ARCH_SW_DIA_0087; ARCH_SW_DIA_0202;

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_PreSafe_Cycles_Level_1_8_CombinedSignal_ReadData*.

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 0300 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_PreSafe_Cycles_Level_1_8_CombinedSignal_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 7: Read 25th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 8: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 9: Read 91st byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
