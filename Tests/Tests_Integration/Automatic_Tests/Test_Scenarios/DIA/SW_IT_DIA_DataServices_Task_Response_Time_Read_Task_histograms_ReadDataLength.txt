Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Test type: automatic
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0635; ARCH_SW_DIA_0639; ARCH_SW_DIA_0640
ARCH_SW_DIA_0635: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID 01E0 (Task Response Time)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0639: Response data length shall be 16 bytes for each task. Note: Full Response length = 3 bytes + Response data length Note: For each task there will be 16 bytes on response meaning that the total length for each task is 16 bytes x 11 tasks = 176 bytes 
ARCH_SW_DIA_0640: Bytes #4 - #15 = Task Histogram [16 bytes]: ?[Byte0] Task ID ?[Byte1] 0-19%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte2] 20-39%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte3] 40-59%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte4] 60-79%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte5] 80-99%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte6] 100-119%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte7] 120-139%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte8] 140-159%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte9] 160-179%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte10] 180-199%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte11] >=200%, PercentUpdate ?[Byte12-Byte15] Max us, Microseconds

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Task_Response_Time_Read_Task_histograms_ReadDataLength*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0635; ARCH_SW_DIA_0639; ARCH_SW_DIA_0640

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 01E0 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Task_Response_Time_Read_Task_histograms_ReadDataLength was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
