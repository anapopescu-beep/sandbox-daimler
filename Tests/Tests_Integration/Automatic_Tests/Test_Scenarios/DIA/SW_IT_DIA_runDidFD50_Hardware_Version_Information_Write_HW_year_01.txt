ARCH_SW_DIA_0517: Runnable shall return 2 bytes, representing YEAR of HW version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD50_Hardware_Version_Information_Write_HW_year*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0515; ARCH_SW_DIA_0517;

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E FD50 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD50_Hardware_Version_Information_Write_HW_year was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write Data byte 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E FD50 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
