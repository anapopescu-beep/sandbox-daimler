Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0000; ARCH_SW_DIA_0051; ARCH_SW_DIA_0052, ARCH_SW_NVP_0003
ARCH_SW_DIA_0000: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID F18C
ARCH_SW_DIA_0051: Service should be available in Default and extended session
ARCH_SW_DIA_0052: NVP_BLOCK_ID_AEE_TRACEABILITY_RamBlockData will be read.
ARCH_SW_NVP_0003: NVP_BLOCK_ID_AEE_TRACEABILITY block shall be configured. Parameter NVP_au8AeeTraceabilityNumber should have 12 bytes and should store AEE ECU Traceability number. (default values 0xFF).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0000; ARCH_SW_DIA_0051; ARCH_SW_DIA_0052, ARCH_SW_NVP_0003

	Step 2: Enter default or extended session.

	Step 3: Set BP in function *DIA_runDidF18C_ECUSerialNumberRead* 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 F18C and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Request sent and timeout received.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_AEE_TRACEABILITY_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
