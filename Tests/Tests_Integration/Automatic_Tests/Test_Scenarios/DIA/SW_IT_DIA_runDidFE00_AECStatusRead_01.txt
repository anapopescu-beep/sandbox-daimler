Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0035; ARCH_SW_DIA_0165; ARCH_SW_DIA_0166
ARCH_SW_DIA_0035: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID FE00
ARCH_SW_DIA_0165: Service shall be available in Development session
ARCH_SW_DIA_0166: Response data shall return AEC_ID_X and Status_X of said AEC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Start Development Session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFE00_AECStatusRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0035; ARCH_SW_DIA_0165; ARCH_SW_DIA_0166

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 FE00 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFE00_AECStatusRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read AEC_ID. 
		Expected result:  Byte was read

	Step 7: Read AEC_Status. 
		Expected result:  Byte was read

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
