Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0041; ARCH_SW_DIA_0183; ARCH_SW_DIA_0184; ARCH_SW_DIA_0185; ARCH_SW_DIA_0186; ARCH_SW_DIA_0187
ARCH_SW_DIA_0041: Service 0x3D will be implemented
ARCH_SW_DIA_0183: Service shall be available in Development session
ARCH_SW_DIA_0184: MemoryIdentifier shall represent Address and Length format identifier
ARCH_SW_DIA_0185: MemoryAddress shall represent the address to write to
ARCH_SW_DIA_0186: MemorySize shall represent the size to write
ARCH_SW_DIA_0187: New R8.1 Feature: MemoryAddress also works with the EEPROM Alias. Hence, the MemoryAddress range for the EEPROM Alias is between: 0xEE000000 - 0xFF000000 EEPROM Alias for each block can be taken from the NVP Excel file on the column U from Dynamic EEPROM. There are in total 27 Blocks that can be modified via the EEPROM Alias. When writing to an EEPROM Alias Block, the Request should look like this: 3D 24 EE 12 00 00 00 01 9C Legend: EEPROM ALIAS BLOCK ADDRESS Data Note: Service 3D supports from DCM several other ALFIDs (Address and Length Format Identifiers). For example, if you want to write 1 byte length of Data the request should be: 3D 14 EE 12 00 00 01 9C Only works via Raw Request.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0041; ARCH_SW_DIA_0183; ARCH_SW_DIA_0184; ARCH_SW_DIA_0185; ARCH_SW_DIA_0186; ARCH_SW_DIA_0187

	Step 3: Send diag request for 3D and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

Postcondition

	Step 4: Return ECU to default values
