Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0285; ARCH_SW_DIA_0286; ARCH_SW_DIA_0287; ARCH_SW_DIA_0288; ARCH_SW_DIA_0289; ARCH_SW_DIA_0290; ARCH_SW_DIA_0291
ARCH_SW_DIA_0285: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID FD01 (SW Version)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0286: The Read SW Version shall be available in the following sessions: Supplier Session/Development Session (0x7E)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0287: Service Read SW Version shall be processed with or without Any form of Authentication.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0288: DataIdentifier of SW Version shall be 0xFD01
ARCH_SW_DIA_0289: Read SW Version service Response DataRecord shall have 12 bytes length
ARCH_SW_DIA_0290: DataRecord: SW Version Bytes 'SN1' to 'SN12' are coded in ASCII and shall reflect the SW Identification (letters and digits allowed)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0291: SNx shall be ordered from MSB to LSB, ASCI coded i.e. bytes #4 to #15 form a string in that order that can be read directly. It will be formatted as follow:Â Â   â¦Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â AABCCZWH.YYY Where: AA-reflects product code, e.g. ER for ECU PP (a.k.a. ERR) B -reflects BM identification according to current software version, e.g. 0 for PP4G Extended CC-reflects customer code, e.g. 18 for DAI Group Z-reflects software type code, 6 for DAI MMA W-Digit subject to change in case the SW release have been modified between SW Freeze and M2 Milestone. H-defines a FLASHED software version YYY-reflects the software version over 3 digit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD01_SWVersionRead*.

	Step 3: Enter development session*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0285; ARCH_SW_DIA_0286; ARCH_SW_DIA_0287; ARCH_SW_DIA_0288; ARCH_SW_DIA_0289; ARCH_SW_DIA_0290; ARCH_SW_DIA_0291

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 0242 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD01_SWVersionRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Evaluate Data Record 
		Expected result:  Variable was read.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
