--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *Synchronize_to_Non_volatile_Memory_RequestResults*.

	Step 4: Send diag request for RID 02 45 Start 
		Expected result:  Request Sent.

	Step 5: Send diag request for RID 02 45 Request Results 
		Expected result:  Timeout error.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0755; ARCH_SW_DIA_0761; ARCH_SW_DIA_0762

	Step 6: Check if breakpoint from function Synchronize_to_Non_volatile_Memory_RequestResults was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
