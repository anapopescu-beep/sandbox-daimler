Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Test type: automatic
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0575; ARCH_SW_DIA_0578; ARCH_SW_DIA_0579; ARCH_SW_DIA_0580; ARCH_SW_DIA_0581; ARCH_SW_DIA_0582
ARCH_SW_DIA_0575: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID FD03 (AEE Traceability Number And PCBA Programmed PN)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0578: Data Identifier of the Read AEE Traceability Number And PCBA programmed PN Service shall be: 0xFD03
ARCH_SW_DIA_0579: Response data length shall be 22 bytes longNote: Full Response length = 3 bytes + Response data length
ARCH_SW_DIA_0580: Response data length shall be 22 bytes long Note: Full Response length = 3 bytes + Response data length 
ARCH_SW_DIA_0581: Bytes #4-#15: ?AEE Traceability Number [ASCII Coded 
ARCH_SW_DIA_0582: Bytes #16-#25: ?PCBA programmed Part Number [ASCII Coded] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD03_PCBAProgrammedPartNumberRead*.

Action:ARCH_SW_DIA_0575; ARCH_SW_DIA_0578; ARCH_SW_DIA_0579; ARCH_SW_DIA_0580; ARCH_SW_DIA_0581; ARCH_SW_DIA_0582

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0220 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD03_PCBAProgrammedPartNumberRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate *Data pointer 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
