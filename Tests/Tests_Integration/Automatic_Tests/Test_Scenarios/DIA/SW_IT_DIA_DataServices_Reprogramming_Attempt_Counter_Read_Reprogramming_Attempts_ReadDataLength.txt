Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Test type: automatic
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0595; ARCH_SW_DIA_0599; ARCH_SW_DIA_0600; ARCH_SW_DIA_0601; ARCH_SW_DIA_0602
ARCH_SW_DIA_0595: Service 0x22 (Read Data By Identifier) will be implemented for DID 0100 (Reprogramming Attempt Counter)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0599: Response data length shall be (4 bytes* number of logical blocks) long. Note: Full Response length = 3 bytes + Response data length
ARCH_SW_DIA_0600: Byte #4 #5: ?Number Of Reprogramming Attempts default value: 0x0000 if ECU erased and Programmed by the ECU supplier.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0601: Byte #6 #7: ?Max. Number Of Reprogramming Attempts
ARCH_SW_DIA_0602: The reprogramming attempt counter shall be incremented by each reprogramming attempt.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Reprogramming_Attempt_Counter_Read_Reprogramming_Attempts_ReadDataLength*.

Action:ARCH_SW_DIA_0595; ARCH_SW_DIA_0599; ARCH_SW_DIA_0600; ARCH_SW_DIA_0601; ARCH_SW_DIA_0602

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0100 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Reprogramming_Attempt_Counter_Read_Reprogramming_Attempts_ReadDataLength was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
