ARCH_SW_DIA_0100: Request data shall be 228 bytes long For R6.0 Request Data shall be 233 bytes long
ARCH_SW_DIA_0101: Blocks NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_26 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_28 and NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_116 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_144 shall be written
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Tensioning_Cycle_BSR_CombinedSignal_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0026; ARCH_SW_DIA_0099; ARCH_SW_DIA_0100; ARCH_SW_DIA_0101

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0302 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Tensioning_Cycle_BSR_CombinedSignal_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write 26th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E 0302 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
