Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD31_HBCalibrationRead*.

	Step 3: Start Development Session.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0033; ARCH_SW_DIA_0162; ARCH_SW_DIA_0163; ARCH_SW_DIA_0164, ARCH_SW_NVP_0002

	Step 4: Send diag request for 22 FD31 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD31_HBCalibrationRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_HB_CALIBRATION_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 7: Read last byte (index = 39) of NVP_BLOCK_ID_HB_CALIBRATION_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

	Step 8: Use the Read service 0x22 for DID FD31. 
		Expected result:  Response is received.

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
