ARCH_SW_DIA_0275: Service 0x14 (Clear Diagnostic Information) will be implemented
ARCH_SW_DIA_0276: The ClearDiagnosticInformation service shall be available in the following sessions: Default Session (0x01) Extended Session (0x03) Supplier Session/Development Session (0x7E) Update Session (0x42)
ARCH_SW_DIA_0277: This service shall be available with or without any form of Authentication.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0278: The ECU shall send a Positive Response when the ClearDiagnosticInformation service is completely processed Explanation: ClearDiagnosticInformation service is considered completely processed when the data used by the ReadDiagnosticInformation (0x19) are cleared
ARCH_SW_DIA_0279: The ECU shall send a Positive Response even if no DTCs are stored in the serverâ€™s memory
ARCH_SW_DIA_0279: The ECU shall send a Positive Response even if no DTCs are stored in the serverâ€™s memory
ARCH_SW_DIA_0280: Each bit mask corresponds to the following DTC Groups: 0x000000 = GROUP_EMISSION_RELATED 0x000002 = GROUP_POWERTRAIN 0x000004 = GROUP_CHASSIS 0x000006 = GROUP_BODY 0x000008 = GROUP_NETWORK_COM 0xA00000 = GROUP_SBE 0XFFFFFF = ALL DTC GROUP

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *Dcm_Svc14Handler*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0275; ARCH_SW_DIA_0276; ARCH_SW_DIA_0277; ARCH_SW_DIA_0278; ARCH_SW_DIA_0279; ARCH_SW_DIA_0280;

	Step 3: Send fault memory clear request.

	Step 4: Check if BP was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
