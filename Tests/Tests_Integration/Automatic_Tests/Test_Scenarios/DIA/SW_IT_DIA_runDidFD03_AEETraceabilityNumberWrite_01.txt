--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0009; ARCH_SW_DIA_0074; ARCH_SW_DIA_0075

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD03_AEETraceabilityNumbeWrite*.

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E FD03 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD03_AEETraceabilityNumbeWrite was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_AEE_TRACEABILITY_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

	Step 7: Send diag request for 2E FD03 
		Expected result:  Response received.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
