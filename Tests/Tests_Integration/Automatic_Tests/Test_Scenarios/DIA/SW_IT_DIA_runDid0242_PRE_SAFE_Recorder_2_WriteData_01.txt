Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0242_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_2_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0250; ARCH_SW_DIA_0258; ARCH_SW_DIA_0259; ARCH_SW_DIA_0390; ARCH_SW_DIA_0391; ARCH_SW_DIA_0392; ARCH_SW_DIA_0484; ARCH_SW_DIA_0485; ARCH_SW_DIA_0486; ARCH_SW_DIA_0487

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0242 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0242_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_2_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
