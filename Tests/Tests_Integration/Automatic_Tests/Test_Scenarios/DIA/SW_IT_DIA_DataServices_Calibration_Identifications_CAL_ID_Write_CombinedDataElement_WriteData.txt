--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Calibration_Identifications_CAL_ID_Write_CombinedDataElement_WriteData*.

ARCH_SW_DIA_0745; ARCH_SW_DIA_0746; ARCH_SW_DIA_0747; ARCH_SW_DIA_0748

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E F804 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Calibration_Identifications_CAL_ID_Write_CombinedDataElement_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
