Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_runMainFunction() at line 'case PAL_KU8_IDLE_MODE_STATE:'.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0070

	Step 3: Check if CPU has stopped at line 'case PAL_KU8_IDLE_MODE_STATE:'. 
		Expected result:  CPU stopped at BP

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_DisablePowerStage() at line 'Dio_WriteChannel (PAL_kstHardWareTopology.astHBridgeDef[PAL_CFG_KU8_HB_P_ID].u16DriveEnableDioId,(uint8)STD_LOW);'.

Action: , ARCH_SW_PAL_0070, ARCH_SW_PAL_0075

	Step 5: Check if CPU has stopped at line 'Dio_WriteChannel (PAL_kstHardWareTopology.astHBridgeDef[PAL_CFG_KU8_HB_P_ID].u16DriveEnableDioId,(uint8)STD_LOW);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU stopped at BP

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function at line 'Dio_WriteChannel (PAL_kstHardWareTopology.astHBridgeDef[PAL_CFG_KU8_HB_N_ID].u16DriveEnableDioId,(uint8)STD_LOW);'.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0076

	Step 7: Check if CPU has stopped at line 'Dio_WriteChannel (PAL_kstHardWareTopology.astHBridgeDef[PAL_CFG_KU8_HB_N_ID].u16DriveEnableDioId,(uint8)STD_LOW);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU stopped at BP

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
