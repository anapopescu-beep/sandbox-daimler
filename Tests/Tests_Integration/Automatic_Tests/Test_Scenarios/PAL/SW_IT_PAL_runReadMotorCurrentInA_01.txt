Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_PAL_0105, ARCH_SW_PAL_0106, ARCH_SW_PAL_0100
ARCH_SW_PAL_0105: If the motor rotation direction is �tensioning�, the AdcIf_runGetMotor_Ip function shall be called to read the motor current measured by the half bridge connected to the VP pin of the motor.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0106: If the motor rotation direction is �releasing�, the AdcIf_runGetMotor_In function shall be called to read the motor current measured by the half bridge connected to the VN pin of the motor.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0100: The component shall provide the current in amps.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0105, ARCH_SW_PAL_0106, ARCH_SW_PAL_0100

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_runReadMotorCurrentInA at PAL_runReadMotorCurrentInmA function call 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_runReadMotorCurrentInmA after the pal_ComputeCurrentHalfBridgeP and pal_ComputeCurrentHalfBridgeN functions call 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

Postcondition

	Step 4: Return ECU to default values
