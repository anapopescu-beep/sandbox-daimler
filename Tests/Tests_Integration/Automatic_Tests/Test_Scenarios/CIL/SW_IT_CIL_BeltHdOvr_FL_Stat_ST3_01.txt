--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set signal BeltHdOvr_FL_Stat_ST3 to I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END (0x1).

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_ComNotification_BeltHdOvr_FL_Stat_ST3_3489841d_Rx ().

	Step 4: Check if CPU stopped in function CIL_ComNotification_BeltHdOvr_FL_Stat_ST3_3489841d_Rx(). 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0408

	Step 5: Evaluate if variable cil_u8BeltHandover is equal to I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END 
		Expected result:  I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
