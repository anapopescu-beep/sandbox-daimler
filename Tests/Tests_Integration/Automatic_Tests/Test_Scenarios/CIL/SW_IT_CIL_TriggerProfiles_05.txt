Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set signal Presf_Lvl_ST3 to I_C04_PRESF_LVL_V2_LVL5 (0x5).

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runCANToAppli at line cil_TriggerProfiles(CIL_stManagedCycle.u8CurrentRequestedCycle);.

	Step 4: Check if CPU stopped at line 'cil_TriggerProfiles(CIL_stManagedCycle.u8CurrentRequestedCycle);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function cil_TriggerProfiles() under case I_C04_PRESF_LVL_V2_LVL5.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0044, ARCH_SW_CIL_0063, ARCH_SW_CIL_0056

	Step 6: Check if CPU stopped in function cil_TriggerProfiles() under case I_C04_PRESF_LVL_V2_LVL5. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint at the end of the function cil_RequestTensioning().

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0079

	Step 8: Check if CPU stopped at the end of function cil_RequestTensioning. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0044, ARCH_SW_CIL_0063, ARCH_SW_CIL_0056

	Step 9: Check if variable Rte_CIL_prrCrashSeverityLevel_u8PreCrashSeverityLevel is KU8_PRECRASH_SEVERITY_LEVEL_4. 
		Expected result:  KU8_PRECRASH_SEVERITY_LEVEL_4 (0x3)

Postcondition

	Step 10: Return ECU to default values
