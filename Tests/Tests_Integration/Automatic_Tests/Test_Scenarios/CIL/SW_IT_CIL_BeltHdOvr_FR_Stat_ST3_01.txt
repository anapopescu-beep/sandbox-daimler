--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set signal BeltHdOvr_FR_Stat_ST3 to I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_ComNotification_BeltHdOvr_FR_Stat_ST3_0eefd507_Rx().

	Step 4: Check if CPU stopped in function CIL_ComNotification_BeltHdOvr_FR_Stat_ST3_0eefd507_Rx. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0407

	Step 5: Evaluate if variable cil_u8BeltHandover is equal to KU8_ZERO. 
		Expected result:  KU8_ZERO

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
