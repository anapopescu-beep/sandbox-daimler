Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_CIL_0116, ARCH_SW_CIL_0052, ARCH_SW_CIL_0059
ARCH_SW_CIL_0116: If Signal RBTMFL_SP_Lvl_Rq_ST35 is different than 0 than next cycle release for previous API requested profiles is inhibitted
ARCH_SW_CIL_0052: If signal is received with value 1, then tensioning cycle 0 shall be requested.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0059: If signal is received with value 1, then tensioning cycle 0 shall be requested.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set signal RBTMFL_SP_Lvl_Rq_ST35 from frame SBeltTens_SP_Lvl_ST3 to KU8_ONE.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in fucntion CIL_runCANToAppli().

	Step 4: Check if CPU stopped at function CIL_runCANToAppli(). 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint at the last line of the function cil_ManageInputSignals and press run.

	Step 6: Check if CPU stopped at the last line of the function cil_ManageInputSignals. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0116, ARCH_SW_CIL_0052, ARCH_SW_CIL_0059

	Step 7: Read variable cil_u8APIActivationRequest. 
		Expected result:  KU8_ONE

	Step 8: Set signal RBTMFL_SP_Lvl_Rq_ST35 from frame SBeltTens_SP_Lvl_ST3 to KU8_ZERO.

	Step 9: Set a breakpoint at the function cil_ManageInhibitConditions.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0116

	Step 10: Check if CPU stopped at function cil_ManageInhibitConditions. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped
