--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runCANToAppli() before line 'cil_ManageInputSignals();'.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0265

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManageAbortingConditions().

	Step 4: Check if CPU stopped in function cil_ManageAbortingConditions(). 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0264

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManageInhibitConditions().

	Step 6: Check if CPU stopped in function cil_ManageInhibitConditions(. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
