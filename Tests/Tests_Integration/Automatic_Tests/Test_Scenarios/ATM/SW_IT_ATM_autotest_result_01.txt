--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in ATM_runMainFunction() function at line atm_PlayOneShotTests();.

Action:ARCH_SW_ATM_0003

	Step 3: Check if CPU is stopped at the breakpoint in ATM_runMainFunction() function at line 'atm_PlayOneShotTests();'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 4: Stept in atm_PlayOneShotTests() function. 
		Expected result:  Stepped in function atm_PlayCyclicTests

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in atm_PlayOneShotTests() function at line 'switch (atm_au8AtStatuses[u8AutotestID])'.

Action: ARCH_SW_ATM_0003

	Step 6: Check if CPU is stopped at the breakpoint in atm_PlayOneShotTests() function at line switch (atm_au8AtStatuses[u8AutotestID]). 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorConnection() at line Rte_Call_pclAutotestServices_GetTestResult(ATM_KU8_ID_TEST_MOSFET_HIGH_SHORT_CIRCUIT, &u8PreviousMosfetHighSCTestResult);.

Action: ARCH_SW_ATM_0002

	Step 8: Check if CPU is stopped at PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorConnection() at line 'Rte_Call_pclAutotestServices_GetTestResult(ATM_KU8_ID_TEST_MOSFET_HIGH_SHORT_CIRCUIT, &u8PreviousMosfetHighSCTestResult);'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
