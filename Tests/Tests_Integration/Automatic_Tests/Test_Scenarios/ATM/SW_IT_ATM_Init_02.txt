Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in ATM_runMainFunction at line 'if (atm_u8StartupTestIndex < (ATM_KU8_NB_OF_STARTUP_AUTO_TESTS + 1u))'.

	Step 3: Check if CPU is stopped in ATM_runMainFunction at line 'if (atm_u8StartupTestIndex < (ATM_KU8_NB_OF_STARTUP_AUTO_TESTS + 1u))'. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped

	Step 4: Set variable atm_u8StartupTestIndex to 0x12.

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in ATM_runMainFunction() at line *atm_PlayOneShotTests();*.

Action: ARCH_SW_ATM_0004

	Step 6: Check if CPU stopped at ATM_runMainFunction() at line *atm_PlayOneShotTests();*. 
		Expected result:  CPU is Running

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
