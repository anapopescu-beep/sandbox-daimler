/* START_COVERAGE_JUSTIFICATION

\ID COV_OS_HALARMCMCOREFREEZE
  \ACCEPT XX
  \REASON This function is called from Os_ErrKernelPanic() right after the panic hook has returned. As the panic hook
          is the last possible exit point for the tests, Os_Hal_CoreFreeze cannot be covered in tests. Because of the
          simplicity of the code, the performed code inspection results in sufficient quality.

Justifications for core:

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMCLZAVAILABILITY
  \ACCEPT TX
  \REASON The condition is hardware dependent always true. The unnecessary code parts should be
          removed by compiler optimization. As the tests run on each platform, the OS is to be released for, we
          always just test the code for the respective platform. No risk as the remaining code shall be optimized
          away. (Other platforms may set ACCEPT XF with a similar justification)

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMPRIVILEGEMODEUSERREADABILITY
  \ACCEPT TX
  \REASON The condition is hardware dependent always true. The unnecessary code parts should be
          removed by compiler optimization. As the tests run on each platform, the OS is to be released for, we
          always just test the code for the respective platform. No risk as the remaining code shall be optimized
          away.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMTHREADPOINTERUSERREADABILITY_XX
  \ACCEPT XX
  \REASON Due to the hardware ability to read the current privileges directly, this function is never called. The
          unnecessary code parts should be removed by compiler optimization. As the tests run on each platform, the OS
          is to be released for, we always just test the code for the respective platform. No risk as the remaining code
          shall be optimized away.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMBITLIBCLZ
  \ACCEPT XX
  \REASON This code is meant as library code for the software implementation of Os_Bit_CountLeadingZeros(). As this
          processor provides a hardware solution, this code is unused. However, the function is extremely simple,
          code inspected and unit tested. It is typically optimized away by the linker. Therefore, the risk of
          keeping this code is expected to be low.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMUNHANDLEDSYSCALL
  \ACCEPT TF
  \REASON This function is only reacheable on some platforms. However, unit test and code inspection have not found
          any risk in keeping this code. The function is fully tested on those platforms which have potentially
          unhandled system calls.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMAPPISPRIVILEGED
  \ACCEPT XX
  \REASON Platform is able to read privileges from hardware. Thus, this function is never used for determination of
          current privileges.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMGETEXCEPTIONCONTEXTAVAILABILITY
   \ACCEPT XF
   \REASON The feature "read exception context" is available on this platform.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMSETEXCEPTIONCONTEXTAVAILABILITY
   \ACCEPT TX
   \ACCEPT XX
   \REASON The feature "modify exception context" is not available on this platform.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORM_NEED_NO_TRAP_IOC_MULTIQUEUE
  \ACCEPT XF
  \ACCEPT XX
  \REASON This path can never be reached on this platform. As IsTrapRequired is always false for multi-queue IOCs
          and the thread pointer is readable in user mode on this platform, no trap is necessary. However, the code is
          unit tested as well as tested on other platforms. Aditionally it is similar to the code used for the call of
          other OS API functios. So there is no risk in keeping this code.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMGLOBAL2LEVELSUPPORTED
   \ACCEPT XF
   \ACCEPT XX
   \REASON Global to level switch is not supported on this platform.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMFRT64BITAVAILABILITY
   \ACCEPT XF
   \ACCEPT XX
   \REASON The feature "64-bit FRT timer" is not available on this platform.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMUNUSED
   \ACCEPT XX
   \REASON The feature is currently unused and will be removed with OSC-5157.
           The unnecessary code parts should be removed by compiler optimization.

\ID COV_OS_HALPLATFORMISRPOSTACTIONAVAILABILITY
 \ACCEPT XX
 \ACCEPT XF
 \REASON This derivative does not meet the hardware requirements to support interrupt post action handling.
         Functionality has been tested on another derivative.
