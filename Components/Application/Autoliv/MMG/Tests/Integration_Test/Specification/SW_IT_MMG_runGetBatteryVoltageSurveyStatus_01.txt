Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_MMG_0202, ARCH_SW_MMG_0207, ARCH_SW_MMG_0208, ARCH_SW_MMG_0406
ARCH_SW_MMG_0202: PMP_runGetBatteryVoltageSurveyStatus shall be called to get the battery voltage.
ARCH_SW_MMG_0207: PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_10ms shall be called to read the KL30 battery voltage to check if measured battery voltage is outside Extended Operating range.
ARCH_SW_MMG_0208: PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_10ms shall be called to read the KL30 battery voltage to check if measured battery voltage is outside Normal Operating range.
ARCH_SW_MMG_0406: PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage shall be called in order to get the battery voltage.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in function MMG_runUpdateModeStatus at line mmg_UpdateModeStatus_PowerVoltageUnstable().

	Step 3: Step in function mmg_UpdateModeStatus_PowerVoltageUnstable.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint at line Rte_Call_pclSurveyBatteryVoltage_GetStatus( &u8BatteryVoltageSurveyStatus).

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint at line pu8BatteryVoltageSurveyStatus = PMP_stBatterySurveyParam.u8BatteryVoltageSurveyState.

Action: ARCH_SW_MMG_0202, ARCH_SW_MMG_0207, ARCH_SW_MMG_0208,ARCH_SW_MMG_0406

	Step 6: Check if CPU stopped at line pu8BatteryVoltageSurveyStatus = PMP_stBatterySurveyParam.u8BatteryVoltageSurveyState. 
		Expected result:  CPU stopped at BP

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
