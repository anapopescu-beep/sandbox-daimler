--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set a breakpoint in the task *ApplInitTask_Core0* at line *ATM_Init();*

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in ATM_Init() function.

Action: ARCH_SW_ATM_0001

	Step 4: Check if the SW has reached breakpoint at ATM_Init(). 
		Expected result:  CPU is Stopped at BP.

Action: ARCH_SW_ATM_0001

	Step 5: Evaluate au8AtStatuses to check if autotests are initialized with KU8_ATM_TEST_NOT_DECIDED (0x0). 
		Expected result:  0x0.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
