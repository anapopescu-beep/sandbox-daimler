Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Get security access.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0241_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_1_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0240; ARCH_SW_DIA_0248; ARCH_SW_DIA_0249

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0241 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0241_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_1_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
