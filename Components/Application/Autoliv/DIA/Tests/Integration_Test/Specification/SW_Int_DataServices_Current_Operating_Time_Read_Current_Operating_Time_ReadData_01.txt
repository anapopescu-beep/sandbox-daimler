--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Current_Operating_Time_Read_Current_Operating_Time_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0325; ARCH_SW_DIA_0326; ARCH_SW_DIA_0327; ARCH_SW_DIA_0467; ARCH_SW_DIA_0468; ARCH_SW_DIA_0469; ARCH_SW_DIA_0470

	Step 3: Send diag request for security access 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Current_Operating_Time_Read_Current_Operating_Time_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
