Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0006; ARCH_SW_DIA_0068; ARCH_SW_DIA_0069; ARCH_SW_NVP_0007
ARCH_SW_DIA_0006: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID FD2A.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0068: Service should be available in Development Session.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0069: NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEPS0 - 144_RamBlockData will be read.
ARCH_SW_NVP_0007: NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0 ï¿½ 144 blocks should be configured. Parameter NVP_au8StepsDefinitions should have 1160 bytes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0006; ARCH_SW_DIA_0068; ARCH_SW_DIA_0083

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 FD2A and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD2A_StepsLibraryRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Action: ARCH_SW_NVP_0007; ARCH_SW_DIA_0069

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
