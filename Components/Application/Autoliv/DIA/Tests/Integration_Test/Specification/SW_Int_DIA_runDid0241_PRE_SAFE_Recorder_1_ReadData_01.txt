--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0241_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_1_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0240; ARCH_SW_DIA_0246; ARCH_SW_DIA_0247, ARCH_SW_NVP_0015

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0241 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0241_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_1_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Evaluate NVP_BLOCK_ID_PRE_SAFE_RECORDER_1_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
