Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0024; ARCH_SW_DIA_0093; ARCH_SW_DIA_0094; ARCH_SW_DIA_0095
ARCH_SW_DIA_0024: Service 0x2E will be implemented for DID 0301.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0093: Service shall be available in Default, Extended and Development session.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0094: Request data shall be 144 bytes long
ARCH_SW_DIA_0095: Blocks NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_29 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_32 and NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_92 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_115 shall be written.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Release_Cycles_BSR_and_PreSafe_CombinedSignal_ReadData_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0024; ARCH_SW_DIA_0093; ARCH_SW_DIA_0094; ARCH_SW_DIA_0095

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0301 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Release_Cycles_BSR_and_PreSafe_CombinedSignal_ReadData_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 6: Write 29th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 7: Return ECU to default values
