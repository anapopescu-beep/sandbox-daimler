Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0243_BSRCounterRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0012; ARCH_SW_DIA_0079; ARCH_SW_DIA_0081

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0243 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0243_BSRCounterRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_EXECUTION_COUNTERS_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
