--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFEFF_MeasuruementFrameConfigurationRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0036; ARCH_SW_DIA_0168; ARCH_SW_DIA_0169; ARCH_SW_DIA_0170, ARCH_SW_NVP_0012;

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 FEFF and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFEFF_MeasuruementFrameConfigurationRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_CONFIG_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
