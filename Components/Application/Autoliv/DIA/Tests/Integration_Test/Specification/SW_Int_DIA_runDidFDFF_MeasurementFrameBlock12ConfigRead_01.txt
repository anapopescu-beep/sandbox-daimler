Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_DIA_0037; ARCH_SW_DIA_0171; ARCH_SW_DIA_0172; ARCH_SW_DIA_0173
ARCH_SW_DIA_0037: Service 0x22 will be implemented for DID FEFF.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0171: Service shall be available in Development session.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0172: Response data shall be 4 bytes long.
ARCH_SW_DIA_0173: Response shall return Ram Address and Size stored in NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_12_CONFIG.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0037; ARCH_SW_DIA_0171; ARCH_SW_DIA_0172; ARCH_SW_DIA_0173

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 FDFF and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_MEASUREMENT_FRAME_CONFIG_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
