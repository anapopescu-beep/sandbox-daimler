Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_HardwareVersion_Read_HW_patch_level_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0370; ARCH_SW_DIA_0371; ARCH_SW_DIA_0372; ARCH_SW_DIA_0373

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 F1 50 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_HardwareVersion_Read_HW_patch_level_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read Data variable 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0370; ARCH_SW_DIA_0371; ARCH_SW_DIA_0372; ARCH_SW_DIA_0373; ARCH_SW_DIA_0374; ARCH_SW_DIA_0471; ARCH_SW_DIA_0472; ARCH_SW_DIA_0473

	Step 6: Send diag request for 22 F1 50 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 7: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_HardwareVersion_Read_HW_year_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 8: Read Data variable 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
