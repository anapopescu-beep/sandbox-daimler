--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD09_LastWarmResetRead_LastDetectedWarmResetCause*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0032; ARCH_SW_DIA_0157; ARCH_SW_DIA_0158; ARCH_SW_DIA_0159

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 FD09 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD09_LastWarmResetRead_LastDetectedWarmResetCause was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_WARM_RESET_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
