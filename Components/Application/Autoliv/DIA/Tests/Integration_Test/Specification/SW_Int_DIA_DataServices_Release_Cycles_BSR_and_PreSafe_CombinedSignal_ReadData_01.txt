ARCH_SW_DIA_0092: Data contained in NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_29 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_32 and NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_92 to NVP_BLOCK_ID_STEP_115 shall be returned.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Release_Cycles_BSR_and_PreSafe_CombinedSignal_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0023; ARCH_SW_DIA_0090; ARCH_SW_DIA_0091; ARCH_SW_DIA_0092;

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0301 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Release_Cycles_BSR_and_PreSafe_CombinedSignal_ReadData. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read 29th byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
