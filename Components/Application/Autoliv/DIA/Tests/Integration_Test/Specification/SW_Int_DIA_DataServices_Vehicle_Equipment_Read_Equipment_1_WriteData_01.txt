Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Vehicle_Equipment_Read_Equipment_1_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0028; ARCH_SW_DIA_0105; ARCH_SW_DIA_0106; ARCH_SW_DIA_0107; ARCH_SW_DIA_0393;

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E 0310 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Vehicle_Equipment_Read_Equipment_1_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
