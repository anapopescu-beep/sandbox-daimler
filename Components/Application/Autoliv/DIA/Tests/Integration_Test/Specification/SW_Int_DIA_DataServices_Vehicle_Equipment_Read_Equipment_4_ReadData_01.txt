--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Vehicle_Equipment_Read_Equipment_4_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0027; ARCH_SW_DIA_0116; ARCH_SW_DIA_0117;

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 03 10 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Vehicle_Equipment_Read_Equipment_4_ReadData. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read Equipment 4 byte of Rte_Ct_MBBL_SsaAppl_Coding_VehicleEquipment 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
