Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter default session.

	Step 3: Enter development session.

	Step 4: Get security access.

	Step 5: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDid0242_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_2_WriteData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0240; ARCH_SW_DIA_0248; ARCH_SW_DIA_0249

	Step 6: Send diag request for 2E 0242 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 7: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDid0242_PRE_SAFE_Recorder_2_WriteData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 8: Return ECU to default values
