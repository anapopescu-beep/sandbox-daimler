--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFD10_CycleConfigurationRead*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0004, ARCH_SW_DIA_0064

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 FD10 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFD10_CycleConfigurationRead was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0065, ARCH_SW_NVP_0006

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
