Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_Global_Time_Sync_Measured_Values_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0460; ARCH_SW_DIA_0461; ARCH_SW_DIA_0462; ARCH_SW_DIA_0463; ARCH_SW_DIA_0464; ARCH_SW_DIA_0465; ARCH_SW_DIA_0466;

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0107 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_Global_Time_Sync_Measured_Values_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read Data pointer value 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
