Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *Dcm_Service27Processor*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0295; ARCH_SW_DIA_0296; ARCH_SW_DIA_0297; ARCH_SW_DIA_0298; ARCH_SW_DIA_0299; ARCH_SW_DIA_0300; ARCH_SW_DIA_0301; ARCH_SW_DIA_0302; ARCH_SW_DIA_0303

	Step 3: Send diag request for security access 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function Dcm_Service27Processor was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
