--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set breakpoint in function *DataServices_PreSafe_Cycles_Level_1_8_CombinedSignal_ReadData*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0021; ARCH_SW_DIA_0086; ARCH_SW_DIA_0087; ARCH_SW_DIA_0202;

	Step 3: Send diag request for 22 0300 and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout received.

	Step 4: Check if breakpoint from function DataServices_PreSafe_Cycles_Level_1_8_CombinedSignal_ReadData was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

	Step 5: Read first byte of NVP_BLOCK_ID_CYCLE_0_RamBlockData 
		Expected result:  Byte was read.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
