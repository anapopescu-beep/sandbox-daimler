--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Enter development session.

	Step 3: Set breakpoint in function *DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigWrite*.

Action: ARCH_SW_DIA_0039; ARCH_SW_DIA_0174; ARCH_SW_DIA_0175, ARCH_SW_NVP_0012; ARCH_SW_DIA_0176

	Step 4: Send diag request for 2E FDFF and wait for timeout error 
		Expected result:  Timeout reached.

	Step 5: Check if breakpoint from function DIA_runDidFDFF_MeasurementFrameBlock12ConfigWrite was reached. 
		Expected result:  BP was reached.

Postcondition

	Step 6: Return ECU to default values
