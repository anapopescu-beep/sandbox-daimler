Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_CIL_0157, ARCH_SW_CIL_0158, ARCH_SW_CIL_0159, ARCH_SW_CIL_0185, ARCH_SW_CIL_0186, ARCH_SW_CIL_0156
ARCH_SW_CIL_0157: Frame BeltHdOvr_FL_State_ST3 shall be manipulated to read all it�s signals and send the values through application.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0159: Frame BeltHdOvr_FR_State_ST3 shall be manipulated to read all it�s signals and send the values through application.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0158: Signal BeltHdOvr_FL_Stat_ST3 shall be send though application when it�s needed (0,1,2,3).
ARCH_SW_CIL_0185: If values for this signal are different than 0x00= RETRACT (Belt hand over retracted).Then all BSR cycles are inhibitted/aborted if signal is enabled in the coding.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0186: If values for this signal are different than 0x00= RETRACT (Belt hand over retracted).Then all BSR cycles are inhibitted/aborted if signal is enabled in the coding.

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Start Development Session.

	Step 3: Set signal BeltHdOvr_FL_Stat_ST3 from frame BeltHdOvr_FL_State_ST3 to I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManageInputSignals at line cil_ManageInhibitConditions();.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0157, ARCH_SW_CIL_0156

	Step 5: Read variable cil_u8BeltHandover 
		Expected result:  0x1.

	Step 6: Set signal BeltHdOvr_FR_Stat_ST3 from frame BeltHdOvr_FR_State_ST3 to I_C02_BELTHDOVR_STAT_OUT_OF_END.

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManageInputSignals at line cil_ManageInhibitConditions();.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0159, ARCH_SW_CIL_0158, ARCH_SW_CIL_0186, ARCH_SW_CIL_0185

	Step 8: Read variable cil_u8BeltHandover 
		Expected result:  0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
