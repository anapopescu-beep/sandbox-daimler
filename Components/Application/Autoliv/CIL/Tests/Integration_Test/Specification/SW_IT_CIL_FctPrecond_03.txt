Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Set signal Bckl_Sw_D_Stat_ST3 to KU8_ONE.

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function cil_ManageFctPrecondSignal.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0111, ARCH_SW_CIL_0109, ARCH_SW_CIL_0110

	Step 4: Check if signal RBTMFL_SP_FctPrecond_Stat_ST35 value is KU8_ONE. 
		Expected result:  KU8_ONE

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
