Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: No
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_CIL_0001, ARCH_SW_CIL_0002, ARCH_SW_CIL_0003, ARCH_SW_CIL_0022, ARCH_SW_CIL_0052, ARCH_SW_CIL_0059
ARCH_SW_CIL_0022: If signal is received with value 1, then tensioning cycle 0 shall be requested.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0052: If signal is received with value 1, then tensioning cycle 0 shall be requested.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0059: If signal is received with value 1, then tensioning cycle 0 shall be requested.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0001: Frame PresfAct_Adj_ST3 shall be manipulated to read all it�s signals and send the values through application.
ARCH_SW_CIL_0002: Signal Presf_Lvl_ST3 shall be send though application when it�s needed.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Start Development Session.

	Step 3: Set signal Presf_Lvl_ST3 to I_C04_PRESF_LVL_V2_LVL1 (0x1).

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function CIL_runCANToAppli at line cil_TriggerProfiles(CIL_stManagedCycle.u8CurrentRequestedCycle);.

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function cil_TriggerProfiles.

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint at the end of the function cil_RequestTensioning.

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0022, ARCH_SW_CIL_0001, ARCH_SW_CIL_0002, ARCH_SW_CIL_0003

	Step 7: Check if CPU stopped in function cil_RequestTensioning. 
		Expected result:  CPU stopped at BP

Action: ARCH_SW_CIL_0022, ARCH_SW_CIL_0052, ARCH_SW_CIL_0059

	Step 8: Check if variable Rte_CIL_prrCrashSeverityLevel_u8PreCrashSeverityLevel is KU8_PRECRASH_SEVERITY_LEVEL_1 
		Expected result:  KU8_PRECRASH_SEVERITY_LEVEL_1.

Postcondition

	Step 9: Return ECU to default values
