Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PMP_1050, ARCH_SW_PMP_1051

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_cbk_CheckPowerSupplyUV at the RTE Call for PMP_Autotest_CheckPowerSupplyUV autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_Autotest_CheckPowerSupplyUV at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached

	Step 5: Write autotest result with 0x1 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with value 0x1

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_Autotest_CheckPowerSupplyUV at the RTE Call for PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_100ms 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 7: Step in.

	Step 8: Run until return PMP_runGetBatteryVoltage_100ms and evaluate *pu16Voltage data pointer 
		Expected result:  Variable read from ADC.

	Step 9: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_Autotest_CheckPowerSupplyUV at the RTE Call for ERH_runGetAecStatus 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 10: Step in.

	Step 11: Run until return ERH_runGetAecStatus and evaluate *pu8AecStatus data pointer 
		Expected result:  Variable read from ADC.

	Step 12: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_Autotest_CheckPowerSupplyUV at the return of autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 13: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PMP_1057, ARCH_SW_PMP_1058

	Step 14: Evaluate u8PreviousADCTestResult 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PMP_1059

	Step 15: Evaluate pmp_u8AECStatus 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to *pmp_u8AECStatus data pointer.

Action: ARCH_SW_PMP_1055

	Step 16: Evaluate pmp_u16FilteredVbatPowerVoltage 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to *pu16Voltage data pointer.

	Step 17: Set a breakpoint in function PMP_cbk_CheckPowerSupplyUV after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 18: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 19: Return ECU to default values
