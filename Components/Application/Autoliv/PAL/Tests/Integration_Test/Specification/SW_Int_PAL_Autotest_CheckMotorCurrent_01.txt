Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: Yes
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_PAL_0340, ARCH_SW_PAL_0343, ARCH_SW_PAL_0341, ARCH_SW_PAL_0342
ARCH_SW_PAL_0340: The component shall check the current used by the motor.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0343: The current executed cycle shall be read from BFE.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0341: Rte_BFE_psrExecutedCycle_u8CycleNumber shall be called  to get the current executed cycle number.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0342: ATM_runGetTestResult shall be called to get the status ot specific tests (inhibiting the execution of the present one if failed).

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0340, ARCH_SW_PAL_0343

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorCurrent at the RTE Call for CheckMotorCurrent autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorCurrent at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 5: Write autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable set to KU8_ATM_TEST_OK

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorCurrent at the return of autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 7: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0341

	Step 8: Evaluate pal_tMotorCurrentEventStatus 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0342

	Step 9: Evaluate ExecutedCycleNumber 
		Expected result:  Variable read.

	Step 10: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorCurrent after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 11: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 12: Return ECU to default values
