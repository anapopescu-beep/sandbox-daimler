Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_PAL_0360, ARCH_SW_PAL_0366
ARCH_SW_PAL_0360: The component shall check if an over temperature of the power stage is reached by returning a SW self-protection status.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0366: The component shall check the state of specific autotests.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0360

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorThermalProctection at the RTE Call for CheckMotorThermalProctection autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorThermalProctection at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 5: Write autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable set to KU8_ATM_TEST_OK

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorCurrent at the return of autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 7: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0366

	Step 8: Evaluate pal_tSwThermalProtectionEventStatus 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

	Step 9: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorThermalProctection after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 10: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
