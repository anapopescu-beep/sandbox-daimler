Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0090, ARCH_SW_PAL_0095

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Init at the pal_Cfg_Init function call to execute config part of initialization 
		Expected result:  CPU is stopped at BP.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function pal_Cfg_Init at the Dio_WriteChannel call to to activate the half bridge 
		Expected result:  CPU is stopped at BP.

Postcondition

	Step 5: Return ECU to default values
