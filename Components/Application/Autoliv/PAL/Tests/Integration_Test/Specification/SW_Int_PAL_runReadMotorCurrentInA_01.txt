Nightly test: No
Test type: Requirement-Based test
Regression Test: Yes
Fault injection method used: No
Resource usage evaluation: No
Priority: No
Safety relevant: No
Requirement under test: ARCH_SW_PAL_0105, ARCH_SW_PAL_0106, ARCH_SW_PAL_0100
ARCH_SW_PAL_0105: If the motor rotation direction is �tensioning�, the AdcIf_runGetMotor_Ip function shall be called to read the motor current measured by the half bridge connected to the VP pin of the motor.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0106: If the motor rotation direction is �releasing�, the AdcIf_runGetMotor_In function shall be called to read the motor current measured by the half bridge connected to the VN pin of the motor.
ARCH_SW_PAL_0100: The component shall provide the current in amps.
