Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0376

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorConnection at the RTE Call for CheckMotorConnection autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorConnection at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 5: Write autotest result with 0x1

	Step 6: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorConnection at the RTE Call for PMP_runGetMotorVp_100ms 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 7: Run until return PMP_runGetMotorVp_100ms and evaluate *pu16Voltage data pointer 
		Expected result:  Variable read from adc.

	Step 8: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMotorConnection at the return of autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 9: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0377

	Step 10: Evaluate PreviousMosfetHighSCTestResult 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0410

	Step 11: Evaluate FilteredMotorPlusVoltage 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to *pu16Voltage data pointer 

	Step 12: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMotorConnection after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 13: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 14: Return ECU to default values
