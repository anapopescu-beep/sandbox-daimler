Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0373, ARCH_SW_PAL_0374

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMosfetOCAT at the RTE Call for CheckMosfetOCAT autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Step in.

	Step 5: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMosfetOCAT at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 6: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckMosfetHighSC at the return of autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 8: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0375

	Step 9: Evaluate PreviousADCTestresult 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

	Step 10: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckMosfetOCAT after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 11: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 12: Return ECU to default values
