Preconditions

	Step 1: Bench Initialization

	Step 2: Run the debugger.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0140

	Step 3: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckHWSelfProtection at the RTE Call for CheckHWSelfProtection autotest 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 4: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckHWSelfProtection at the RTE call for GetTestResult 
		Expected result:  BP reached..

	Step 5: Run until return in function ATM_runGetTestResult.

	Step 6: Write autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable overwritten with 0x1

	Step 7: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_Autotest_CheckHWSelfProtection at the test result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 8: Overwrite autotest result with KU8_ATM_TEST_OK 
		Expected result:  Variable is set to 0x1.

Action: ARCH_SW_PAL_0147

	Step 9: Set a breakpoint in function PAL_cbk_CheckHWSelfProtection after the return of the autotest result 
		Expected result:  BP reached.

	Step 10: Read autotest result transmited from ATM 
		Expected result:  Variable is equal to 0x1.

Postcondition

	Step 11: Return ECU to default values
