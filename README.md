# sandbox-daimler

Welcome to the **sandbox-daimler** repository! This workspace contains a modular automotive software project for automotive ECUs (Electronic Control Units), focusing on embedded systems, safety, diagnostics, and compliance with industry standards. This project implements an AUTOSAR-compliant ECU. Below you'll find an interactive guide to the structure, technical details, and how to get started.

## üîë Technical Keywords



**MCU / Microcontroller:**
- **Platform in use:** Infineon AURIX2G (TriCore tc33x)
- **Core:** TriCore (tc33x variant)
- **Vendor:** Infineon Technologies
- **Toolchain:** TASKING VX-toolset for TriCore
- Used for real-time control, safety, and diagnostics in automotive ECUs

**ECU Functions and Main Functionalities:**
	- This project concerns a single automotive ECU for occupant safety, diagnostics, and secure boot.
	- Main features include:
		- Crash detection, occupant protection, and airbag deployment
		- Boot process management, secure startup, and firmware integrity checks (Boot Manager)
		- Firmware flashing, update, and rollback (Bootloader, Updater)
		- Cryptographic operations, secure key storage, and authentication (HSM)
		- Vehicle diagnostics (UDS/KWP), error logging, and reporting
		- Communication over CAN, LIN, FlexRay
		- Functional safety (ISO 26262 compliance, ASIL levels)
		- Traceability, static analysis, and quality assurance

**Product Details:**
- Automotive ECUs for occupant safety (airbag, seatbelt), secure boot, and diagnostics
- Boot Manager (BM) is responsible for secure boot, firmware validation, and update coordination
- Suppliers: Autoliv and others
- Modules: Bootloader (FBL), HSM (Hardware Security Module), Boot Manager (BM), Updater modules

**Norms & Protocols:**
- AUTOSAR (Automotive Open System Architecture)
- CAN, LIN, FlexRay (vehicle communication protocols)
- ISO 26262 (Functional Safety, ASIL levels)
- UDS (ISO 14229), KWP (ISO 14230) for diagnostics
- Security: HSM, cryptographic modules

**Compliance & Quality:**
- Static analysis (QAC), code coverage, traceability
- Integration/unit testing, safety-relevant requirements
- Reports and metrics for quality assurance

**Release & Traceability:**
- Binaries: ELF, HEX, MAP files
- Test and coverage reports
- Traceability to requirements and architecture

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Explore the Architecture**: See `Architectures/Application/Description/` for design interface docs (DOCX, AUTOSAR ARXML)
2. **Build & Flash**: Follow the guides in `Methods/HowTo/` (DOCX) for step-by-step instructions
3. **Run Static Analysis**: Use scripts in `Metrics/Static_Analysis/` (e.g., `run_qac.bat`, `PP4G_QAC_Analysis.py`) for compliance and code quality
4. **Check Releases**: Find binaries and maps in `Releases/R09.0_P91/` (ELF, HEX, MAP)
5. **Automate Tasks**: Leverage Python and batch scripts in `Scripts/` for CI/CD, reporting, and more
